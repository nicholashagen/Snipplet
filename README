Snipplet is an online web application for interacting with Gists via the
GitHub API in order to category, tag, and better manage Gists.  It also
allows a social aspect of following other users and public Gists and
being able to quickly snip or fork another Gist.

Gists are becoming more and more widely used as a place to store snippets
of code.  However, the management of those snippets is increasingly difficult
to deal with.  Snipplet hopes to take Gists to the next level by providing
a new web interface to add categories and tags that make searching, locating,
and re-using Gists easier.  Think of Pinterest for developers.  By using
Snipplet, you can take snippets or templates of commonly used code and
apply them to categories such as Design Patterns, Java Code, Grails code,
Python Code, Enterprise Features, Messaging Features, etc.  The categories
are custom to you to better manage your snipplets!

This code is very pre-alpha and not ready for consumption.  If you are interested
in helping bring this code to final fruition and launch, let me know.
